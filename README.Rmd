The goal of overviewR is to make it easy to get an overview of your data by displaying your sample information. At the moment, you have two functions (```overview_tab``` and ```overview_crosstab```) that allow you to generate  a tabular overview of your general sample and conditional sample. ```overview_print``` then converts this output to nicely usable tex code.

## Installation

You can install the released version of overviewR from [github](https://github.com/cosimameyer/overviewR) with: 

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("cosimameyer/overviewR")
```

<!--[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("overviewR")
```
-->

## Example

Before we delve into the functions, we need some data to showcase the magic that ```overviewR``` can perform. We have 19 observations for 4 countries (Rwanda, Angola, Benin, and UK) stored in the ```countries``` variable, over a time period between 1990 to 1999 (```years```). As you can tell, we have some gaps in the time frame. We also add randomly generated values for the GDP (```gdp```) and the population size (```population```).

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# Generate some data
# Set a seed to make it reproducable
set.seed(68163)

# Countries
countries <-
  c(rep("RWA", 4), rep("AGO", 8), rep("BEN", 2), rep("GBR", 5)) 

# Time frame 
years <-
  c(seq(1990, 1995),
    seq(1990, 1992),
    seq(1995, 1999),
    seq(1991, 1999, by = 2)) 

# GDP
gdp <-
  runif(19, 10000, 40000) # Add a numeric vector for additional data (randomly generated)

# Population size
population <-
  runif(19, 100, 50000)# Add another numeric vector for additional data (randomly generated)

# Combine vectors to a data frame
df_combined <-
  data.frame(countries, years, gdp, population, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Let's have a first look at the data:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(df_combined)
```

Load the package
```{r}
library(overviewR)
```

### ```overview_tab```
Generate some general overview using ```overview_tab```.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
overview_tab(dat = df_combined, id = countries, time = years)
```

This function automatically generates an object and stores it in your environment so that you can access it later.

### ```overview_crosstab```
If you want to generate a cross table that divides our data conditionally on two factors, this can be done with ```overview_crosstab```. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
overview_crosstab(
    dat = df_combined,
    cond1 = gdp,
    cond2 = population,
    threshold1 = 30000,
    threshold2 = 15000,
    id = countries,
    time = years
  )
```

The resulting data frame is again stored as an object in your environment so that you can access it later.

### ```overview_print```

To generate an easily usable \LaTeX output, ```overviewR``` offers the function ```overview_print```. 

```{r}

```

<!--
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
